# JavaScript Code Starter

This repo implements the functions on code.org's App Lab.

If you are familiar with the App Lab, you can use the functions like

* `setText(id, "text")` - set the text of an element
* `onEvent(id, "click", function () {})` - run a function on event
* `getText(id)` - get the text of an element or input

## Usage

Clone this repository or use it as a template.

Edit the files `index.html` and `script.js`.

Leave the file `code-org-fns.js` alone. It defines the functions you may use and helps with compatibility with code.org's App Lab functions.
